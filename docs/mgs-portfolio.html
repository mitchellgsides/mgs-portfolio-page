            <a name="about"><h1>About</h1></a>
            <p>     I'm a full stack developer and student of programming languages and technology. 
                Prior to development, I was a professional cyclist and coach, as well as a high school 
                teacher in science and physical education. While coaching elite athletes using advanced 
                analytical software targeted at individualizing coaching (TrainingPeaks' WKO4, Golden 
                Cheetah, TrainerRoad, and others), I discovered a passion for nuanced and unique software. 
                With Bloc, I found an effective educational structure and a support system of mentors to 
                acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to develop my own applications. I'm currently 
                seeking employment in an area where I can integrate non-technical knowledge with my passion 
                for code to develop powerful and effective solutions across various domains.
            <br></br>
            <p>     In my time as an athlete, I've learned that a dedication to consistency and building 
                on strong foundations with the help of skilled mentors leads to success, and I've carried these lessons forward
                into my pursuit of new skills and technical knowledge. I still enjoy training and 
                racing my bike across the US with the development team I own and direct. To relax, I 
                value spending time outdoors with my wife, Lydia, and our dog, Solomon. We 
                particularly enjoy backpacking, camping, and hiking in the Rocky Mountains and across 
                Texas.</p>
